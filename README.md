This is the Git lab for CSCI 213 Software Development. One class was added, Car.java,
which extends the abstract Vehicle class. The Car class contains the following:

* two instance variables
	* numOfDoors
	* numOfPassengers
* a parameterized constructor for all current and super instance variables
 	* Car
* getters for the instance variables in this class
	* getDoors
	* getPass
* the toString method
* the equals method
* a copy method
